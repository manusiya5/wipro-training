//     Functional Programming and Pure Functions.

// What is pure functions  ---    where we focus on what to do rather then how to do 
// traditional functions --- like for , foreach --
//  here we were focussing on what to do but also on how to do (logic)


// Pure functions are like : - map()
// 
// , reduce() and filter()

// map() -> when we want to transform each element in an array and it return a new array.

// filter() -- when we want to select specific elements that meet a condition or when we want to extract the data 

// reduce() -- when we want to return a single value after accumulating array values that we have or we want to 
// summarize or to get aggregate data 

// == We want to calculate the total sum of 10 natural numbers  sum += sum +n
// p arrow function will take each product p from an array and return a new object 
  // ...(spread) means- it will copy all properties of the original product and apply discount on it

        // traditional way for incrementing the salary

        for(let i=0 ; i<salaries.length ; i++)
